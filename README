This is a curses interface for pulseaudio.

It is far from complete, but it's already very useful to conveniently
move around sink inputs, and adjust volume levels individually.

Branch info: This branch supports the equalizer module through dbus. It is not
perfect yet, in particular the screen does not refresh when equalizer settings
are externally modified. It's also a complete hack, use at your own risk yada
yada :)

What's working:
 - event handling
 - some info displayed
 - volume of sinks and sink inputs
 - moving sink inputs around
 - volume of sources and source outputs
 - controlling channel levels individually
 - some sample management
 - experimental, basic equalizer support

TODO (in no particular order):
 - robustnes of ui, probably tons of curses newbie mistakes in there
 - more and better structured info
 - equalizer profiles
 - equalizer by channel
 - equalizer event listening?
 - proper error handling for equalizer
 - use gobject loop?
 - support -s for equalizer
 - finish script execution (is that even possible?)
 - cards screen (ie, for profile changing)
 - bugs, bugs

This package depends on argparse and libpulseaudio.
