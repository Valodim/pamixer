This is a curses interface for pulseaudio.

It is far from complete, but it's already very useful to conveniently
move around sink inputs, and adjust volume levels individually.

What's working:
 - event handling
 - some info displayed
 - volume of sinks and sink inputs
 - moving sink inputs around
 - controlling channel levels individually

TODO:
 - robustnes of ui, probably tons of curses newbie mistakes in there
 - finish script execution
 - more sample management
 - more and better structured info
 - cards screen (ie, for profile changing)
 - bugs, bugs, bugs

The lib_pulseaudio bindings come from a seperate repository as a submodule, to
automatically clone these and track do:
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

The bindings were made for pulseaudio 0.9.22, so they probably crash
and burn for older versions.
